            "We did have a spare key and we took that off.",
            "And that's the soil and substance of our problems with the spacecraft.",
            "At approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes before launch, we did run into a little difficulty with a LOX vent valve on the S-IC stage which we were attempting to cycle; open and close as required for the venting process, and it stuck on us in the full-open position, and we ran through a repeated number of cycles attempting to free it and for some time were unsuccessful in doing so.",
            "It caused us concern in that if we had not been able to close the vent valve, we would not have been able to pressurise the LOX tank at T minus 72 seconds.",
            "However, we did run some nitrogen gas through the system and we were able to sufficiently raise the temperature such that we were able to close the valve and we proceeded the rest of the way with that vent valve in a closed position at all times and we do have a second vent valve in the stage that we relied on to give us the correct conditions at time of stage pressurisation at T minus 72 seconds.",
            "Those two items were the soil and substance of the problems that we encountered during the entire countdown.",
            "As most of you know by this time, the first stage burn was perfectly nominal.",
            "You may have noticed that it seemed almost like an eternity before the vehicle cleared the tower.",
            "That, of course, was because this is the heaviest vehicle that we've flown.",
            "It was approximately 26,000 pounds heavier at lift-off than Apollo 12 and the S-IC engines, though they were perfectly within specification, were rated at about 100,000 pounds total thrust less than those that we had on the Apollo 12 vehicle.",
            "This made the time about one half to three quarters of a second longer in clearing the tower.",
            "All of the first stage burn, as I mentioned earlier, was perfectly nominal.",
            "The second stage burn was nominal up until the time that the S-II inboard engine cut off.",
            "That engine is normally cut off by switch selector command approximately 90 seconds before the outboard engines are cut off.",
            "For some reeason that we have not been able to determine at this time, the engine did cut itself off approximately 2 minutes earlier than planned.",
            "Now, as a result of that having happened, the outboard engines of course burned approximately a half a second [means minute] longer; they burned to fuel depletion and made up some of the energy that was lost by virtue of the inboard engine having cut off early, and when we burned the S-IVB, it burned approximately half a minute longer than originally planned in order to make up the deficiency and at the end of the first burn of the S-IVB, the deficiency was made up.",
            "Now, we had approximately 2,200-pound payload margin for this mission.",
            "We used up a little but of that margin by the fact that the engine did cut off early but we did not use up enough to",
            "to lose any confidence in our ability to perform the TLI manoeuvre.",
            "We do still have a 3-sigma capability.",
            "So, we have no reason to suspect that we will not have a good TLI burn and fly a perfectly nominal mission from this point on.",
