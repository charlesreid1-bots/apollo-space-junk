after max-q, but still was a rumbling bird.", "The S-II was a Cadillac", "quiet, less than 1g flight most of the time until we built up our g-load prior to staging.", "It was quiet, smooth, had very little noise, or feeling of rumbling or anything else.", "The S-IVB", "a light little chugger is probably the best way I can describe it, which is not different than I remember it in the past.", "It just sort of rumbled on, not anywhere near the extent of the S-IC, but just sort of continued to rumble on through the burn.", "After a while, especially during TLI, it got to be a very pleasant, warm feeling that she was burning like she should burn.", "Evans, from 1973 Technical debrief", "Chugging, I think, has two different connotations.", "I felt the S-IVB was more of a very light rumble in the background, something that is kind of rumbling as opposed to chugging.", "A chug to me is a bang-bang type thing, and to me it was more of a rumble.", "Schmitt, from 1973 Technical debrief", "I agree, it may be a sense of rumbling but the ride was smooth.", "I could sense some activity behind it, but I wouldn't have said that it was chugging.", "Cernan, from 1973 Technical debrief", "I'll modify chugging to say it was a hummocky chug, just a rolling type.", "Nothing different, and, as I say, the best recollection, similar to the S-IVB I had the opportunity to ride on before, but probably even more steady and continuous flow of light rumbling.", "Members of Government-Industry team that launched Apollo 17 Saturn V space vehicle applaud remarks by Vice President Spiro T.
